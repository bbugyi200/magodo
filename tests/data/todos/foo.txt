===== Foo File =====
I do lots of stuff in this file. Some lines are todo tasks, but some lines are headers. Some
other lines are apart of text paragraphs.

----- Todo List #1 -----
(N) First item.
(A) High-priority item @high
(A) High-priority item. @high

----- Todo List #2 -----
x (B) 2022-01-10 2022-01-01 Done item
(N) 2022-01-11 Item is due:2022-01-31.
x (Z) 1999-01-01 1900-01-01 This +test item is awesome:True awesome and has lots of @stuff too_long:NoWay DoFoo:22
Not a valid "strict" todo
x Done item with no priority is a valid "strict" todo
o A lowercase "o" can also be used when running in "strict" mode.
o (N) But this "o" can only be used if a priority is NOT provided.
(N) Don't + make + normal + pluses + projects.
(N) Ditto for keys: with no values.
(N) We strip +punctuation. But not if the value:. is just @punctuation, ya:dig?
(N) +project We allow descriptions to start with projects.
(N) @context We allow descriptions to start with contexts.
(N) 1234 Todos can start with numbers:5678.
x:1545 Todos can easily log their "done times" with this trick.
o Double colons should be::ignored.
o Sometimes we want to use apostrophe with +project's or @contexts'.
o We also ignore double ++pluses and double @@at signs.
